Week 7 has begun and I should mention that this is the week before
spring break and I leave for florida half way through the week so 
this week it is going to be a little less. However the first thing 
that I have done is to get it so that when the deck ends you compare
your hands and if it is a tie there is a tie breaker. I started this 
last week but I had to take it out. The next thing I did was back to 
the handmaid. The handmaid is now showing up and somewhat working. I 
have tested it and so far it works fine so I am not too sure if I 
should fix anything before I move on to the prince.
