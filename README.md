## Introduction
Loveletter is a traditional card game that must be played by more than one player. It is a game that involves both chance and skill. For my senior project I have created an web based game that allows a user to play against a computer. The computer does make smart and intelligent moves that are all carefully made and to make it seem like you are in fact playing a real person. You can find the rule at this website for more information.
