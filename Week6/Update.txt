So this is a new week and the first thing I wanted to do
was to fix the fact that the computer was not showing it 
second card when it was its turn due to time outs but 
kyle helped fixed this and this is no longer and issue.
I also spent a lot of time trying to figure out a different
approach to do growl messages. I tried putting in bootstrap type
growl messages but the css that had to come with it totally messed
up my own css so I decided not to move forward with it (https://github.com/ifightcrime/bootstrap-growl)
Another thing I had to do and spent a little more than two days with is that
I had to redo how I was making my deck. It was something that I took 
from Advanced web but did not realize that I was making two different
decks with each of the players so I am glad that I caught that. 
Now I have a deck file that works as a player in a way such that
now the players somewhat share the deck and call upon it to
deal a new card and see if the deck is now empty. I also added
a function that deals with if there are no more cards left in
the deck.
