So this is a new week and the Baron card is up and running. 
I have not been able to make the computer play it since it will
only play the lower card so that is kind of annoying. My deck 
size isn't not working properly either. Also my biggest issue is
that I cannot make the delay happen where I want so that it looks
like the computer has two cards which is the worse thing that I 
have encountered so far. I also made it so that the tokens of 
affection are now properly showing up. I really had to battle 
with the css for them to show up in the bottom but this also
caused me to move the just played cards up to the top. I also had
to change the size of the wrapper and all the tables. For the past
two week I have had an error:
"Uncaught TypeError: 
((n.event.special[g.origType] || 
(intermediate value)).handle || g.handler).apply 
is not a functionn.event.dispatch @ jquery.min.js:3r.handle 
@ jquery.min.js:3"
